# CustomFeats
A mod that allows you to create custom feats in Forager via mods. Press TAB to view your feats and their progress.

## How To
Simply define a feat using `FeatCreate`, and set the progress using `FeatSetProgress`! You can pass in a script index into the `reward` argument to run code (such as give an item) upon completing the feat.
